Antibody binding prevents interaction with the CTLA-4 ligands CD80 and CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 results in increased T cell activation and proliferation. Ipilimumab was the first immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive FDA approval as a cancer therapy. Treatment of patients with advanced metastatic melanoma with ipilimumab monotherapy resulted in improved overall survival. Subsequent clinical trials with ipilimumab alone and in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies have demonstrated impressive clinical activity in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers. Side effects of ipilimumab result from autoimmune attack on healthy tissues. Side effects may include dermatitis, colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopathies, nephritis, arthritis, neuropathies and others.|Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody that binds the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1. Nivolumab binding to PD-1 blocks interaction with the PD-1 ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.

Administration of recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) has been shown to result in a dramatic increase of circulating CD8+T cells and NK cells; these changes in immune cell populations suggest potential for anti-tumor activity.|Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, a receptor present on the surface of activated T cells that functions as an immune checkpoint. Immune checkpoints pathways typically act to downregulate T cell activity and are co-opted by tumors to allow the malignant cells to evade the immune response. Blocking the engagement of CTLA-4 with ipilimumab allows infiltrating T cells to mount an anti-tumor response. Ipilimumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain patients with melanoma and has shown clinical activity in other tumor types as well.|Nivolumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1), a receptor present on the surface of activated T cells that functions as an immune checkpoint. One of the ligands for PD-1, PD-L1, is commonly expressed by tumor cells. Similar to inhibition of the CTLA-4 pathway by ipilimumab, blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling by nivolumab allows infiltrating T cells to mount an an immune response against the tumor.
